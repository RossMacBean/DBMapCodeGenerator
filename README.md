# DBMapCodeGenerator
A very simple tool that generates Java database code for multiple Database vendors

This tool was created as part of a research project into the compatibility of different Database vendors by measuring how closely they follow the SQL specification.

It works buy inspecting the metadata exposed by a DBMS, then generating Java wrappers to call stored procedures found in the metadata.
